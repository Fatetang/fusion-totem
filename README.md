# Fusion Totem
Sound-reactive RGB LED strips mounted under a portable sun umbrella.

## Preface
When attending big music festivals it's easy to lose your friends in the crowd so people sometimes use an umbrella, a flag or similar to spot each other easily. Some people get creative and make something custom, sometimes called a "festival totem". I was going to go to Fusion festival (outside of Berlin) with a big group of people and I was also looking for some kind of project to learn more about electronics and Arduino programming so this was a perfect opportunity to create something for me and my friends.

#### Requirements
- Light-weight and durable (to be carried around and danced with for hours)
- Battery time of 3 hours
- Final assembly on-site (We went to the festival by bus so I wanted to transport the bigger parts in the baggage compartment and the the delicate electronics with me on the passenger deck)

#### Nice-to-have
- Look cool af
- Reactive to sound
- Battery time of 6 hours or more

## Main parts
These are the main parts I bought specifically for this project. I already had a stock of basic electronics components, various screws and bolts, plastic case, cables etc. I also already owned a light-weight 5V/10.000 mAh powerbank that I wanted to use as my power supply.
