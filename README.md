# Fusion Totem
Sound-reactive RGB LED strips mounted under a portable sun umbrella. Built for Fusion Festival 2018.

## Main parts
These are the main parts I bought specifically for this project. I already had a stock of basic electronics components, various screws and bolts, plastic case, cables etc. I also already owned a light-weight 5V/10.000 mAh powerbank that I used as power supply.
